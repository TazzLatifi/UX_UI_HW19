        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>Ciana’s goal is to prevent the marginalization of new immigrants and refugees and facilitate their
            successful integration in their new country - The need for motivated volunteers is integral for the
            success of this NGO.
            My research findings were that the website lacks the structure and visual presence to effectively
            represent their goals and needs for those that are interested in becoming their advocates through
            volunteering or fundraising.
            The project requires improvements to the navigation, logistics and branding of the website so that the
            users can understand the goals while easily navigating the structural interface of the site. The users
            should feel engaged, excited, and easily understand the steps they can take to become volunteers or
            become involved in order to help with the cause and to carry out Ciana’s mission in helping immigrant
            communities through the volunteering process.

            <h2>CIANA User Research</h2>
            <p>When this project was started we made the assumption that our users were the immigrants looking for legal
                and educational support.
                -I chose to keep the initial survey general and have the interviewees guide us. The questions I asked
                were definitely more focused on the immigrant community using the site - see question below and on
                graphic:
                -What does the organization do and what is the scope of their work and if that information was obvious
                when looking through the site.
                -Asked our users to find out information about assistance and the types of services they offer.
                - Asked our users to look at the process of donation and what the getting involved / volunteer
                opportunities looked like and to describe the opportunities.
                -My final question during my initial interview series of the users was would they recommend the site to
                new immigrants….
                <em> As you will see in the interview documentation we learned the assumption that the immigrants were
                    the users was inaccurate.</em>

            <p> Lessons learned:
                The researchers questions and methods are as integral to achieving an intuitive design as is the user
                testing which opens the pathways to better design and convention.
